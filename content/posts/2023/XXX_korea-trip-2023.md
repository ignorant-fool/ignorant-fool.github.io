... and I'm back! A *big bit* over a month or few later I return with the second entry to this blog! Who'd've thunk that studying and working at the same time would leave me with no free time :upsidedownface:.

 Today I'm going to be discussing some solo travel I recently did over the most recent Christmas/New Years period! This trip was the culmination of my "fuck covid" period, and allowed me to finally get some closure on losing my early twenties to that damn disease. To understand why, we'll need to go back to *the before*, to December of 2019.

As a Christmas (and graduation from honours) present to myself, I had booked a holiday to Japan over the 2020 Christmas and New Years period. Due to *reasons*, that trip never happened, and my graduation got delayed, and ...     I don't think I really need to say much more, everyone knows the covid is and how it fucked up everyone's life for a few years (and continues fucking up lives for some even still now). Obviously having this trip cancelled sucked big-time, but I knew it would be okay, I would eventually get to go.

Until Japan never opened their borders for nearly three years.

During that three year wait, one of my close friends had moved to South Korea, and in early 2022 they had jokingly said I should come visit. I still had the money I put away for Japan, so thought "bet", and booked the trip to Korea then and there. This turned out to be really bad timing, as Japan *did* end up opening their borders about a month later BUT I had committed: I was to venture to South Korea first instead.

Now up to this point, I didn't really know all that much about South Korea. I'd always been a *weeaboo*, not a *koreaboo*, so I had a few months to get up to speed, learn about the country, and prepare for this trip. I spent a lot of time on YouTube looking up travel blogs, I'd read pretty much every post posted on the /r/TravelKorea subreddit from February 2022 onwards, and most importantly, I spent hours trawling through HappyCow looking for where I could eat. Turns out there are a lot of great veg*n places to eat in Seoul (not so much the other cities I visited, but we'll get to that later), and I'll be writing about them down below. I went in to 

I knew I was never going to learn Korean, but I had to get the "sound" of the language in my head (like I have the "sound" of Japanese), and the best way to do that was to watch KDramas - so in the lead-up to the trip I watched two dramas on Netflix. The first was *Itaewon Class*, which was INCREDIBLE. The male lead won me over on Kdramas from pretty much the first episode. It's been a while since I watched so I'm can't really be more eloquent in my review but yeah, amazing show. I always thought Kdramas were kinda *cringe* (yes, I understand the irony of saying that coming from a weeb) but this show demonstrated they can be anything but.   The other show I watched was *Extraordinary Attorney Woo*, which was also incredible. East Asian countries aren't exactly known for their treatment of those with physical or other disabilities, so this show was a real treat. The female lead played her part very convincingly, and her dad was such a good character as well. Again it's been a while, buy highly recommend people watch either of these to get into Kdramas!

From my pre-trip readings, the most important things I had to get before the trip were actually just two smartphone apps: papago and Naver Maps. Papago is like Google Translate, but on steroids for the Korean language, while Naver Maps is, well, Google Maps on steroids (for South Korea). Papago is used just like Google Translate - point and click photos, speak into it, or even type. I often used it at convenience stores when looking at ingredients, or to offer compliments at restaurants. Naver will tell you the exact train line to go on, as well as what train car to make it quickest on the entering and leaving the station. The trains and bus timetables are always accurate. Anyone going to Korea **MUST** download these apps to help get around. I didn't use any rideshare or taxi's whilst over there, so can't speak to whether Uber of KakaoT are as useful as others say they are.

With al



Below is literal copy and paste from reddit post. Need to reformat, re-write and tidy up, and also make it have some _flair_. 
Also need to add some things:
- download papago and naver maps. papago for kr>eng translation (take photo bam translated) and naver for maps. I didn't use any rideshare or taxi trips so cant comment on any apps for that. naver is so useful, tells you exact train station entrance/exit to use, and even which door on the train to use to make it quicker. 
- get money out at Incheon train station to buy public transport (Tmoney) card (but don't get the 100 000 KRW as the machine won't accept them!). Also probably bring a coin purse, very useful.

Hey fam, spent the christmas and new years period in Korea, figured I‚Äôd do a quick write up to show that yes, you can be vegan easily (mostly) in Korea! Any vegan/vegetarian/plant-based person should 100% download HappyCow, as it lists most restaurants with vego options! Highly recommend. And if you find new places PLEASE add them to help future veg*n people find places to eat!

I'm 25M from Australia, vegan, and don't speak any Korean (except for hello, thank-you, yes, and no). For this trip, I had the expectation that I would have to be lenient with regards to eating vegan, however I found that I didn't really have many problems. I only accidentally had animal products four times over the two weeks, so I consider this trip a success (and those four could've been missed if I could speak or read Korean).

2022-12-21 Perth > Sydney

Flew to Seoul via Sydney (no direct flights from Perth, sadge).
Once in Sydney, I pre-booked all of my KTX tickets (Seoul>Gwangju, Gwangju>Daejeon, and Daejeon>Seoul) as well as installed my eSim (LGU+). eSim was very handy, always having connection throughout the country for Naver maps and HappyCow.
2022-12-22 Sydney > Seoul

Early flight to Seoul, took about 11 hours. Landed about 8 pm, got through immigration in under 30 minutes, then took a bus to the hotel. Stayed at Four Points by Sheraton Josun for the night, as I had a good deal from QANTAS airline.
2022-12-23 Seoul > Gwangju

Woke up, had breakfast at the hotel then took a train to Gwangju, arriving around 5 pm.Walked outside of the station at Gwangju to SNOW which was pretty amazing (coming from 38 degrees in Perth to -5 in Korea was great!!). Stayed at Culture Hotel LAAM whilst in Gwangju - right near downtown and ACC, highly recommended if visiting the city.
Unfortunately both the places nearby I‚Äôd earmarked from HappyCow to eat at were closed that night, so I settled for some oreos and churros from CU, along with some chips from KFC for dinner.
2022-12-24 Gwangju

Spent the day acclimatising to Korea with my friend who lives locally. Learned that the vast majority of cafes do not have alternative milks, so anyone who prefers oat/almond/soy is generally stuck with Starbucks (so bad, so so bad). Fortunately we found a matcha cafe, Metcha, that served oat milk so we grabbed a coffee here.
We had lunch at a bibimbap shop, where my friend ordered the bibimbap without egg or meat for me. Unfortunately it still came out with the meat, so my friend scooped it all out to add to her meal instead. The kimchi here was also fishy, so be wary of that (ended my first bite of kimchi with a ü§Æface). These are the first two of four times I had animal products.
After lunch we went to the buddhist temple near Mudeungsan National Park, and watched the sunset at Cafe Zizz.
Then went back downtown to have dinner at High Street Mexican, a new Mexican-American restaurant that serves vegan tacos. We also ordered the loaded fries without the cheese, sour cream, or bacon, but it did come with sour cream (there was a miscommunication between the owner who speaks perfect english and the cook). No biggie, I just ate around the sour cream. This was the third of four times I had animal products.
Ended the night having some cocktails at Bibideu, barstaff were very fun as they tried to speak English with us.
2022-12-25 Gwangju

Christmas day! My first ‚Äúwhite christmas‚Äù (almost, at least, no actual snowing but plenty of snow on the ground from overnight).
We had lunch at First Nepal, an Indian restaurant in the city. Had the vegan channa masala, very delicious. First Nepal has a number of vegan options and the staff are aware of what vegan means.
Afterwards we went for tea at a cafe called Zuzen with some of my friend‚Äôs friends. As it was christmas, we saw quite a few couples inside having dates which was cute.
We then went to ACC (Asian Culture Complex), but didn‚Äôt really have the time to see everything. Biggest regret was not giving this more time, as the exhibits were really interesting to look at.
Dinner at another bibimbap place, this time with no animal products at all! Lovely.
2022-12-26 Gwangju > Daejeon

Sad to say bye to my friend, but I had to move to the next city on my trip, Daejeon. Daejeon was far-and-beyond the most difficult for eating, as where I was staying and what I was visiting was very far from anything on HappyCow. The next 24 hours was essentially oreos, churros, and starbucks üò¢
Before heading to Daejeon, I went to Penguin Village. Although it was ‚Äúclosed‚Äù, I could still get in to see all the street art which was great. Then took the KTX to Daejeon, checked into the hotel (Hotel ICC) and wandered towards the Shinsegae department store.
Bought a ticket to Art Space 193, and had some panoramic views of the city from the top of the 42 storey building, as well as attend the art exhibition.
Not much to speak of food-wise, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable trying to order something with the meat removed by myself üòÜ
2022-12-27 Daejeon > Seoul

Today was the main reason I came to Daejeon - the KIGAM geological museum! I‚Äôm a geoscientist by trade, and a nerd to boot, so I knew I had to come here. Spent the morning exploring the museum and rock garden. I spent 2.5-3 hours here, but would see most people getting through in 2 at the most.
Was planning on going to the science museum afterwards, but instead decided ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and wandered the Expo Civic Square and the town instead.
Afterwards, I took the KTX back to Seoul for the remainder of the trip. In Seoul I stayed in Hongdae at L7 Hongdae, a very foreigner-friendly hotel right next to Hongdae station, which made getting around the city very easy. I can definitely recommend staying here.
Had dinner at Plant, a vegan restaurant a short walk from the hotel. Had the cheeseburger and fries, felt good to sink my teeth into actual food after eating nothing but snacks yesterday.
2022-12-28 Seoul

Not much to say about today, I spent it mostly inside, doing laundry at the hotel and finalising plans for the rest of the trip. Went out to grab some tofu kimbap from a convenience store. What I thought was vegan (translated the ingredients as no animal products) turned out to have imitation crab in it (no idea how the translation missed that). I was starving so I sort of just pushed it all out and ate the rest, it was still gross though. This was the final time I had animal products.
For dinner I went out to Go Thai - had the vegan green curry and a thai beer, both so so so good.
2022-12-29 Seoul

First proper touristy day in Seoul, I started off by going to Maru JaYeonSik Kimbap to get some (actual) vegan kimbap. Grabbed the ham and the tofu both to go.
I then walked to Gyeongbokgung Palace, getting slightly lost on the way (took a wrong turn following Naver). Getting lost was fun though, as I went to a buddhist temple while they were doing their morning prayer!
The palace itself was lovely, although I didn‚Äôt rent a hanbok, watching those that did was very fun. The place reminded me a lot of when I went to China a few years ago, which makes sense in the long-run I guess. The outdoors section has a lovely set of ‚ÄúPhallic-shaped Objects of Worship‚Äù statues, highly recommended as those rocks are hella lewd and made me giggle.
Followed up the palace by going to the folk history museum, they had a lovely little exhibition for the year of the rabbit.
Ended with dinner at Cow Tteokbokki near Ewha Women‚Äôs University - guys, gals, and non-binary pals, this was the best meal I had on my trip. The vegan rose tteokbokki here was absolutely divine, EVERYONE should try eating here, fucking delicious.
2022-12-30 Seoul

Went to the war memorial, hangul museum, and national museum today. Stopped off at Dotori first to grab some vegan baked goods as snacks, plenty of options (although I wouldn‚Äôt say they tasted the best).
The War Memorial was really nice, I didn‚Äôt really cover much of this in history class at school so I was happy to learn more about the Korean war and Korea‚Äôs history of being invaded (900 times??).
Then took the train down to the museums - starting with the Hangul Museum. Although I can‚Äôt speak or read Korean, it was lovely to see how the language developed, and really only pretty recently. The National Museum was also great, easy to spend hours wandering around.
After the museums, I went to HYBE Insight to do some modern-cultural learnings. I wasn‚Äôt exactly a mega kpop stan prior to this trip, but woo boy after visiting here I‚Äôve certainly added a number of (too many?) kpop songs to my playlists. Baekho is bae btw.
Had dinner at Peace Park, a newish vegan place nearby. Such a vibe, food was great though a tad expensive. Would be good to come to the wine bar here with friends for a relaxing night of drinks.
After dinner I refreshed at the hotel then went out for some drinks. Met some locals that could speak English and bar hopped before ending at Thursday Party which is seemingly the foreigner bar in Hongdae.
2022-12-31 Seoul

a few too many drinks last night, so I went to Plant again for a hangover cure. Philly cheesesteak with a banana split really hit the spot. Walked around for a few hours until my friend arrived in Seoul. Did some shopping before getting ready for new years.
Had dinner at Oh Se Gae Hyang. Lovely delicious veganized traditional Korean food, but it‚Äôs totally run by some weird vegan cult thing.
Went for pre-drinks at a bar in Itaewon called The Workshop. Owned by South Africans who love their football.
Then headed back to Thursday Party for the new years countdown and more drinks!
2023-01-01 Seoul

More drinks meant we needed some recovery - this time at Lucyd Cafe, an AUSTRALIAN cafe ran by a couple from Brisbane. Had the best coffee so far in Korea (with oat milk ‚ô•Ô∏è) and an avo on toast, a truly classic Australian brunch menu.
We then went to Seoul Forest and wandered Seongsu before going to Tongue Planet, a weird esoteric cafe. Eerie music and weird vibes, it was great.
Said goodbye to my friend who had to head back to Gwangju. I went back to Hongdae, and had dinner at Darc-en-ciel, a small vegan restaurant not too far from the hotel. They had a special menu for the new years, so I had the mushroom bourguignon with a glass of the house red, and it was absolutely delicious. Should‚Äôve come here more üò¢
2023-01-02 Seoul

I ventured out to Gangnam and COEX mall today. Had lunch at Plantude, a vegan restaurant in the mall. PRetty average, but that‚Äôs probably more-so the item I ordered rather than the place itself. I don‚Äôt recommend the somen noodles! COEX was just like any other mall, bought a light jacket and t-shirt, and browsed the rest. The library was cool, but you definitely don‚Äôt need a trip out to see it if you‚Äôre not interested in shopping.
After COEX I went to Yeouido park and a walk along the Han River, as this is what the locals I met drinking the other night suggested. Was very chill and relaxing, although very cold walking along the river.
Went to Vezza for dinner, a short bus ride from the hotel. The vegan mac and cheese was THE BEST mac and cheese I‚Äôve ever had in my life, even before I went vegan. Pepperoni pizza was also good, but god damn that mac and cheese will live in my memories forever.
2023-01-03/04 Seoul > Sydney > Perth

Final day in Seoul, very sad. Packed up, left luggage at the hotel and then went to Namsam tower. It was such a clear day, and had a great view of the entire city. Was also there just in time for the beacon lighting ceremony (happens at noon). Essentially it was just the guards doing a short demonstration, but nothing of real substance. If you‚Äôre there in time it‚Äôs okay, otherwise not really worth planning a trip around.
Rest of the day was spent eating and crying about having to go home. Had lunch at Alt.A in Itaewon, the kimchi fried dumplings were divine and the mapo tofu was delicious. Then went and had after-lunch snacks at Panhonesta nearby, an oat milk latte and sweet cupcake.
Then went back to the hotel to grab luggage and head to the airport. Flew overnight back to Sydney then on to Perth. Sad being back but also good to not be cold everywhere I go.
Overall a great trip, 10/10 do recommend. I understand why there's not a lot of travel recommendations over the winter period as it was heckin' cold, but sometimes the cold is what you want. Just pack a suitably-puffy jacket (I bought a vegan one online from Noize) and you'll be fine.

Happy to answer any questions :)
