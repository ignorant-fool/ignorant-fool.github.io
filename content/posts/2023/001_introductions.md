Hello friends, and welcome to the first post on this "blog".

My name is ignorant-fool (or Harrison), and I'm currently working as a Geodata Scientist in the minerals exploration space. That means I'm part geoscientist, part data scientist, and part data engineer - essentially I implement some cool machine learning and statistics on geoscientific data to find pretty looking rocks! I can't really share much more than that due to confidentiality (however my boss did recently spill the tea about some stuff we're working on, which can be read in [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20231103173256/https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/11/01/could-ai-help-find-valuable-mineral-deposits) from _The Economist_).

Due to that, I'll instead be writing on things that aren't to do with work - things like travel, hobbies, and anything else I feel inclined to write about :smile:. There's a pretty long laundry list of things I'm interested in, so expect really any of the following to pop up: seeing and playing music, (geo)science and tech, cooking and eating (vegan) food, east-Asian culture (Japan, South Korea, China), weeb culture, drinking beverages (coffee, tea, beer), stationery, fashion, esports (League, TFT, WoW PvE), and more recently watching the Sumo!

And I think that's enough for an intro! Not sure who is or why anyone would be reading this, but thanks, I guess! Look forward to very infrequent posts over the next while!
