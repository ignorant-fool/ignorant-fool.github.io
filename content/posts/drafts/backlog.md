2. Collections (we live in a capitalist society after all)

3. Rig Rundown/s
    - Instruments (guitars, basses, percussion)
    - PC + Desk setup (include other tech. too)

3. Plagioclase when you finally start doing more work on it lmao.

4. Find an interesting paper and try to recreate the results on some public data. Do a write up and share :smile:.
