### Preamble

I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to travel - as a family we did a few trips around Queensland while I was growing up, but never anything truly substantial. My first overseas trip was a cruise with my extended family when I was 21. Compared to most of my friends, I was definitely a late bloomer there.

Bring on 2019 - I was starting my Honours degree, and set to graduate at the end of 2020. Being the weeb I am, I obviously decided to treat myself to a trip to Japan. I had everything planned and booked, and then, well... 

2020 happened.


_Need I say any more._


Two-and-a-bit years later, Australia was open, but Japan was not. I desperately needed to go on holidays, and fortunately had a friend from university living in South Korea. Having not seen them for a few years, I figured "let's go" and booked tickets about three weeks before Japan opened up (oops).

### Preparation

Up to this point in my life, I didn't really know all too much about South Korea. I have and always will be a *weeaboo*, not a *koreaboo*, which means I only had around four months to get up to speed and learn about the country to prepare for this trip. I spent an ungodly amount of time watching and researching travel vlogs on YouTube, reading every post for about six months straight onr /r/KoreaTravel, and most importantly, trawling through *HappyCow* convincing myself that "_going to an Asian country will be okay_", foodwise.

I don't speak any Korean at all, but I knew I had to get the "sound" of the language in my head as best as I could, and I figured the most entertaining way to do this was to finally start watching K-dramas - so in the lead-up to the trip I watched (embarrassingly only) two dramas on Netflix. The first was **Itaewon Class**, which was INCREDIBLE. The male lead won me over on K-dramas from the first episode. Prior to this, I'd always thought that K-dramas were *cringe* (I do understand the irony of me saying this, as I watch a worrying amount of anime), but this showed me just how great they really can be.
The other show I watched was **Extraordinary Attorney Woo**, which was also incredible. East-Asian countries are typically known for their treatment of those with disabilities (to be fair, what countries are?), so this show was a real treat. The female lead played her part very convincingly, and her dad was such a charming character as well. I had a few more in my list, but never found the time to watch.

My non-cultural preparations included getting my phone ready, and getting my clothes ready. Based on my research, I knew I had to get two apps on my phone: *Papago* and *Naver Maps*. *Papago* is like Google Translate, but on steroids for the Korean language, while *Naver Maps* is Google Maps, but actually useful in South Korea. [This video](https://youtu.be/0Pqcwj4zI0k?si=lQa75g4SiUkXYNrn) has a good explanation on why Google Maps is useless in South Korea.
*Papago* is used exactly like Google Translate is -- point and click for photos, speak into it, or even type. I mainly pointed it at menus and other writings to figure out what was written. *Naver Maps* is a godsend for getting you from place A to place B. It will tell you the train to take, along with which train car will be closest to your desired exit. The train and bus timetables were always accurate. Anyone going to South Korea **must** download these two apps.

The other app I used heavily was of course *HappyCow*, which is a global app to help vegans and vegetarians find food! I highly recommend this to anyone who is vegan, especially when they are travelling to countries where they do not speak the language! I used *HappyCow* to plan out at least 90% of what I ate the entire trip, so it's obviously my third most recommended app (for me it was number one). Over the entirety of the trip, I only accidentally had animal products four times, which is significantly less than I had expected when I started planning this trip!

In terms of getting my closet ready, it should be noted that I live in *Australia*. When I left, it was starting to hit 40 degrees Celsius. When I landed in Seoul, it was -5 degrees Celsius, very big difference. I had never experienced sub-zero temperatures before, hell I'd hardly experienced sub-10 degrees temperature, so I needed a big ol' puffer jacket to be able to survive. Being vegan, it can be very difficult to cold-weather gear that does not contain wool - fortunately the team over at [Noize](https://noize.com/products/mens-short-puffer-w-fixed-hood-faux-sherpa-lined-body-hood?variant=39782961053761) had me covered with their excellent vegan puffer!

With all that out of the way, let's get in to the day-by-day rundown! I'll throw a few photos in where I can, and will provide links to restaurants or interesting sights!


### The trip!
#### 2022-12-21 Perth :airplane: Sydney 
I, for better or worse, live in Perth, Western Australia. There are no direct flights from Perth to Seoul, which means I had to take a detour via the east-coast of Australia, opting to go through Sydney for this trip.
I spent the night at *ibis Budget St Peters*, which, honestly, wasn't the best, but it was budget, and that's all that matters. I did manage to walk across to [Yulli's Brews](https://www.happycow.net/reviews/yullis-brews-alexandria-133759) for dinner, where I had a very delicious ginger pale ale and the eggplant curry hotpot with rice. On the walk back I wandered through Sydney Park before heading back to the hotel.
Once back and showered, I went and pre-booked all of my KTX tickets and installed my eSim ready for when I landed the next night.

#### 2022-12-22 Sydney :airplane: Seoul
Woke up bright and early to catch a flight to Seoul - took around 11 hours. I flew with Qantas, and landed into Incheon at about 8:00 pm. Getting through immigration was quick, probably around the 30 minutes mark. After grabbing my bags, I walked outside into the coooooooooooold, with snow on the ground. I almost tripped on the ice, I was so excited!
Walked to the train station and hit my first snag - the machine to buy a Tmoney card (the public transport card) did not take card! I wandered over to the ATM and withdrew money, and then hit my second snag (there's a pattern emerging here) - the machine to buy the Tmoney card did not take the denomination I withdrew (100,000 KRW)! I wandered over to KFC, bought a drink, and then finally bought a Tmoney card with the changed. Loaded it up with 40,000 KRW (way too much) and hopped on the first train into Seoul.

Once I got to Seoul, I knew I hit my third snag - I could not for the life of me figure out how to get to my hotel. Now, I'm a geoscientist, I'm good with maps, and I still got lost trying to find the underground pathway to the hotel. I ended up venturing outside in the cold (this was approximately 10:00 pm), and struggling my way to find the bus and get to my hotel. I seriously contemplated crying at one point - I thought to myself, "had I made a mistake doing solo travel to a country I couldn't speak the language?"

After about 45 minutes I found the correct bus and got to the hotel. I had a warm shower, and settled down. I stayed at the *Four Points by Sheraton Josun, Seoul Station* - this was an amazing room, and I wish I could have afforded to have stay here the entire time I was in Seoul.

I went to sleep in a comfy bed, ready to get up early ready for another day of travel.

#### 2022-12-23 Seoul :train: Gwangju
After a quick breakfast at the hotel, I went to the station early, ready to catch a KTX train to Gwangju, and then hit my fourth snag - I had put all the times in my phone's calendar while I was in Sydney, meaning I got to the station almost *two hours* before the train. Not my smartest moment, but I'm just glad I was there early and not late. I spent the two hours doing a quick walk around Seoul Station, and ended up grabbing a coke at McDonald's (since I didn't think anything else would be vegan at all).

I then caught the train direct to Gwangju, arriving at around 5:00 pm. Walking out of the station to see snow falling for the very first time was one of the most amazing things I experienced on this trip.


![First snow in Gwangju!](/images/001a_Gwangju-snow.png)


I then started the trek to my hotel for the stay - *Culture Hotel LAAM*. This is right by downtown and the Asian Culture Centre (ACC), I highly recommend this hotel if coming to Gwangju. 

Unfortunately both the places nearby I had earmarked in *HappyCow* to eat at were closed that night due to the heavy snow, so I instead settled for some oreos and churros (and a sneaky bottle of soju) from the nearest CU. Unsurprisingly that didn't fill me up, so I walked down to KFC to grab some chips (vegan!) and then wandered back through Democracy Square outside ACC - it was fully decked out with Christmas decorations, and the snow was past my shins!

#### 2022-12-24 Gwangju 
The first "proper day", which I spent acclimatising to South Korea with my friend who lives here in Gwangju.

2022-12-24 Gwangju

Spent the day acclimatising to Korea with my friend who lives locally. Learned that the vast majority of cafes do not have alternative milks, so anyone who prefers oat/almond/soy is generally stuck with Starbucks (so bad, so so bad). Fortunately we found a matcha cafe, Metcha, that served oat milk so we grabbed a coffee here.
We had lunch at a bibimbap shop, where my friend ordered the bibimbap without egg or meat for me. Unfortunately it still came out with the meat, so my friend scooped it all out to add to her meal instead. The kimchi here was also fishy, so be wary of that (ended my first bite of kimchi with a 🤮face). These are the first two of four times I had animal products.
After lunch we went to the buddhist temple near Mudeungsan National Park, and watched the sunset at Cafe Zizz.
Then went back downtown to have dinner at High Street Mexican, a new Mexican-American restaurant that serves vegan tacos. We also ordered the loaded fries without the cheese, sour cream, or bacon, but it did come with sour cream (there was a miscommunication between the owner who speaks perfect english and the cook). No biggie, I just ate around the sour cream. This was the third of four times I had animal products.
Ended the night having some cocktails at Bibideu, barstaff were very fun as they tried to speak English with us.



2022-12-25 Gwangju

Christmas day! My first “white christmas” (almost, at least, no actual snowing but plenty of snow on the ground from overnight).
We had lunch at First Nepal, an Indian restaurant in the city. Had the vegan channa masala, very delicious. First Nepal has a number of vegan options and the staff are aware of what vegan means.
Afterwards we went for tea at a cafe called Zuzen with some of my friend’s friends. As it was christmas, we saw quite a few couples inside having dates which was cute.
We then went to ACC (Asian Culture Complex), but didn’t really have the time to see everything. Biggest regret was not giving this more time, as the exhibits were really interesting to look at.
Dinner at another bibimbap place, this time with no animal products at all! Lovely.



2022-12-26 Gwangju > Daejeon

Sad to say bye to my friend, but I had to move to the next city on my trip, Daejeon. Daejeon was far-and-beyond the most difficult for eating, as where I was staying and what I was visiting was very far from anything on HappyCow. The next 24 hours was essentially oreos, churros, and starbucks 😢
Before heading to Daejeon, I went to Penguin Village. Although it was “closed”, I could still get in to see all the street art which was great. Then took the KTX to Daejeon, checked into the hotel (Hotel ICC) and wandered towards the Shinsegae department store.
Bought a ticket to Art Space 193, and had some panoramic views of the city from the top of the 42 storey building, as well as attend the art exhibition.
Not much to speak of food-wise, I didn’t feel comfortable trying to order something with the meat removed by myself 😆



2022-12-27 Daejeon > Seoul

Today was the main reason I came to Daejeon - the KIGAM geological museum! I’m a geoscientist by trade, and a nerd to boot, so I knew I had to come here. Spent the morning exploring the museum and rock garden. I spent 2.5-3 hours here, but would see most people getting through in 2 at the most.
Was planning on going to the science museum afterwards, but instead decided “fuck it” and wandered the Expo Civic Square and the town instead.
Afterwards, I took the KTX back to Seoul for the remainder of the trip. In Seoul I stayed in Hongdae at L7 Hongdae, a very foreigner-friendly hotel right next to Hongdae station, which made getting around the city very easy. I can definitely recommend staying here.
Had dinner at Plant, a vegan restaurant a short walk from the hotel. Had the cheeseburger and fries, felt good to sink my teeth into actual food after eating nothing but snacks yesterday.



2022-12-28 Seoul

Not much to say about today, I spent it mostly inside, doing laundry at the hotel and finalising plans for the rest of the trip. Went out to grab some tofu kimbap from a convenience store. What I thought was vegan (translated the ingredients as no animal products) turned out to have imitation crab in it (no idea how the translation missed that). I was starving so I sort of just pushed it all out and ate the rest, it was still gross though. This was the final time I had animal products.
For dinner I went out to Go Thai - had the vegan green curry and a thai beer, both so so so good.



2022-12-29 Seoul

First proper touristy day in Seoul, I started off by going to Maru JaYeonSik Kimbap to get some (actual) vegan kimbap. Grabbed the ham and the tofu both to go.
I then walked to Gyeongbokgung Palace, getting slightly lost on the way (took a wrong turn following Naver). Getting lost was fun though, as I went to a buddhist temple while they were doing their morning prayer!
The palace itself was lovely, although I didn’t rent a hanbok, watching those that did was very fun. The place reminded me a lot of when I went to China a few years ago, which makes sense in the long-run I guess. The outdoors section has a lovely set of “Phallic-shaped Objects of Worship” statues, highly recommended as those rocks are hella lewd and made me giggle.
Followed up the palace by going to the folk history museum, they had a lovely little exhibition for the year of the rabbit.
Ended with dinner at Cow Tteokbokki near Ewha Women’s University - guys, gals, and non-binary pals, this was the best meal I had on my trip. The vegan rose tteokbokki here was absolutely divine, EVERYONE should try eating here, fucking delicious.



2022-12-30 Seoul

Went to the war memorial, hangul museum, and national museum today. Stopped off at Dotori first to grab some vegan baked goods as snacks, plenty of options (although I wouldn’t say they tasted the best).
The War Memorial was really nice, I didn’t really cover much of this in history class at school so I was happy to learn more about the Korean war and Korea’s history of being invaded (900 times??).
Then took the train down to the museums - starting with the Hangul Museum. Although I can’t speak or read Korean, it was lovely to see how the language developed, and really only pretty recently. The National Museum was also great, easy to spend hours wandering around.
After the museums, I went to HYBE Insight to do some modern-cultural learnings. I wasn’t exactly a mega kpop stan prior to this trip, but woo boy after visiting here I’ve certainly added a number of (too many?) kpop songs to my playlists. Baekho is bae btw.
Had dinner at Peace Park, a newish vegan place nearby. Such a vibe, food was great though a tad expensive. Would be good to come to the wine bar here with friends for a relaxing night of drinks.
After dinner I refreshed at the hotel then went out for some drinks. Met some locals that could speak English and bar hopped before ending at Thursday Party which is seemingly the foreigner bar in Hongdae.



2022-12-31 Seoul

a few too many drinks last night, so I went to Plant again for a hangover cure. Philly cheesesteak with a banana split really hit the spot. Walked around for a few hours until my friend arrived in Seoul. Did some shopping before getting ready for new years.
Had dinner at Oh Se Gae Hyang. Lovely delicious veganized traditional Korean food, but it’s totally run by some weird vegan cult thing.
Went for pre-drinks at a bar in Itaewon called The Workshop. Owned by South Africans who love their football.
Then headed back to Thursday Party for the new years countdown and more drinks!




2023-01-01 Seoul

More drinks meant we needed some recovery - this time at Lucyd Cafe, an AUSTRALIAN cafe ran by a couple from Brisbane. Had the best coffee so far in Korea (with oat milk ♥️) and an avo on toast, a truly classic Australian brunch menu.
We then went to Seoul Forest and wandered Seongsu before going to Tongue Planet, a weird esoteric cafe. Eerie music and weird vibes, it was great.
Said goodbye to my friend who had to head back to Gwangju. I went back to Hongdae, and had dinner at Darc-en-ciel, a small vegan restaurant not too far from the hotel. They had a special menu for the new years, so I had the mushroom bourguignon with a glass of the house red, and it was absolutely delicious. Should’ve come here more 😢




2023-01-02 Seoul

I ventured out to Gangnam and COEX mall today. Had lunch at Plantude, a vegan restaurant in the mall. PRetty average, but that’s probably more-so the item I ordered rather than the place itself. I don’t recommend the somen noodles! COEX was just like any other mall, bought a light jacket and t-shirt, and browsed the rest. The library was cool, but you definitely don’t need a trip out to see it if you’re not interested in shopping.
After COEX I went to Yeouido park and a walk along the Han River, as this is what the locals I met drinking the other night suggested. Was very chill and relaxing, although very cold walking along the river.
Went to Vezza for dinner, a short bus ride from the hotel. The vegan mac and cheese was THE BEST mac and cheese I’ve ever had in my life, even before I went vegan. Pepperoni pizza was also good, but god damn that mac and cheese will live in my memories forever.




2023-01-03/04 Seoul > Sydney > Perth

Final day in Seoul, very sad. Packed up, left luggage at the hotel and then went to Namsam tower. It was such a clear day, and had a great view of the entire city. Was also there just in time for the beacon lighting ceremony (happens at noon). Essentially it was just the guards doing a short demonstration, but nothing of real substance. If you’re there in time it’s okay, otherwise not really worth planning a trip around.
Rest of the day was spent eating and crying about having to go home. Had lunch at Alt.A in Itaewon, the kimchi fried dumplings were divine and the mapo tofu was delicious. Then went and had after-lunch snacks at Panhonesta nearby, an oat milk latte and sweet cupcake.
Then went back to the hotel to grab luggage and head to the airport. Flew overnight back to Sydney then on to Perth. Sad being back but also good to not be cold everywhere I go.
Overall a great trip, 10/10 do recommend. I understand why there's not a lot of travel recommendations over the winter period as it was heckin' cold, but sometimes the cold is what you want. Just pack a suitably-puffy jacket (I bought a vegan one online from Noize) and you'll be fine.

Happy to answer any questions :)
